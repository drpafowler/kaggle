# My Kaggle Files
This is just a place for me to keep all of my Kaggle Workbooks

## Notebooks

## why?
I prefer to work in VS Code over the browser based Kaggle Notebooks. I also like to keep my work in a git repository. This is a good place to keep everything.

## How?
I replicated the Kaggle environment on my computer by installing the same version of Python and using pip freeze to get a list of all the packages.  

I then work in VS COde and use the Kaggle API to download the data.

After I have finished with the workbook I sync with GitHub and then upload the workbook to Kaggle.
